# BatikClassification Android
 This project is aimed at completing a university assignment. It involves developing  a mobile image classification app using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and the Flutter framework. Leveraging a dataset obtained from Kaggle, the app will empower users to capture or upload images, and in real-time, it will accurately classify them into various classes. By fine-tuning the MobileNetV2 model with the Kaggle dataset and optimizing for fast inference, the app will offer efficient and reliable image classification results. The user-friendly interface will provide a seamless experience, displaying the predicted class along with the confidence level for each classification, making it a valuable tool for diverse image recognition tasks. Upon successful completion and deployment on the Android platform, this project will showcase our skills in deep learning, mobile app development, and deployment, contributing to the growing field of AI-powered mobile applications.
